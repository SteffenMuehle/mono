# central limit theorem

the central limit theorem is one of the most fundamental theorems in the mathematical field of statistics.
It says that the sum (or mean) of a large number of identically distributed random variables converges towards a Gaussian, regardless of how the individual distribution looks like, so long as it has a variance.
