# variance of sum

Let us consider the variance of the sum of random variables. It can be shown that so long as the variables are independent, their variances simply add up.
This means that the standard deviation of the sum grows as the square-root of the number of variables. This is fundamental for uncertainty measures of things growing with time, i.e. diffusion processes.
