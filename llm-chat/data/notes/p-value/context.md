- p-value
    - paradigm: measured data - is there an effect, or not?
    - p=probability of getting the observed or more extreme data. Calculated by assuming null hypothesis
    - probability of **data**, not of theory!!!!
    - $\alpha=0.05$
    - assuming NULL, all p-values in [0,1] are equally likely!!
    - assuming notNULL, p-curve is decreasing! ("p-curve analysis")

how to calculate p?
- use analytical distro of your statistics if available
- generate and histogram randomly generated data sets if distro given
- permutation histogram
