Examples:

1. $O(1)$: constant time
	- get last element of list
	- get dict/hash table by key
2. $(log(n))$: logarithmic time
	- whenever in each iteration, you cut something in half
	- binary search
3. $O(n)$ linear time
	- add all numbers in a list
4. $O(nlog(n))$ linearithmic time
	- sorting algorithms
5. $O(n^2)$ quadratic time
	- do something with all pairs of elements in a list
6. $O(2^n)$ exponential time
	- when time doubles with each new element
	- cardinality of powerset (set of all subsets)
6. $O(n!)$ factorial time
	- number of permutations
