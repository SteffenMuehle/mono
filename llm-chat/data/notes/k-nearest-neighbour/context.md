knn

- **Type**: Supervised Learning Algorithm
- **Purpose**: Classification and Regression
- **How It Works**:
  - Considers the 'K' nearest neighbors of a data point for decision-making.
  - In classification, assigns a data point to the class most common among its 'K' nearest neighbors.
  - In regression, assigns the average outcome of the 'K' nearest neighbors.
- **Key Features**:
  - Non-parametric and lazy learning algorithm.
  - The performance is sensitive to the choice of 'K' and the distance metric used (e.g., Euclidean, Manhattan).
