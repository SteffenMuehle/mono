When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure.

examples:
- Vietnam rat killings: tails as proof -> people start breeding rats
- Google pagerank -> websites start making fake websites for incoming links
- TOEFL tests
- pay workers for hours spend in office
- paper citations
- unit testing code coverage
